# Telecom-Churn-Analysis
This repository contains an end-to-end churn analysis project for a telecom dataset. It combines data science (Python) and business intelligence (Power BI) to identify factors influencing customer churn and provide actionable insights for retention strategies

🚀 Project Overview

Goal: Predict whether a customer is likely to churn and identify the key drivers behind churn.

Tech Stack:

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) for data preprocessing, EDA, and model building

Power BI (.pbix) for interactive dashboard visualization

Dataset: Telecom customer records with demographic, usage, and contract information.

📝 Contents

Telecom Customer Churn.pbix → Power BI dashboard with churn KPIs and insights

Predictions.csv → Predicted churn outcomes from the ML model

notebook.ipynb → Python notebook with EDA, feature engineering, and churn prediction model (logistic regression / random forest etc.)

📈 Key Insights

Identified top churn indicators (tenure, contract type, payment method, monthly charges).

Built a machine learning model to classify churn vs non-churn customers.

Designed an interactive Power BI dashboard for churn trends, KPIs, and customer segmentation.

🔑 Features

Data preprocessing and feature engineering

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations

Machine Learning model for churn prediction

Business-friendly dashboard for decision making
